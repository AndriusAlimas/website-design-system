Website Design System
=====================

---
#### This project is a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.

###### As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

## Project Guidelines

 ***Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as you’d like.***

***Your style guide should include a labeled section outlining the colors to be used. Each color should have:***

### 1.
  > - A name (you can come up with this name yourself)
  > - A box displaying the color itself.
  > - he CSS value used to create the color (in hex, ```rgb()```, ```rgba()```, ```hsl()```, or ```hsla()```).
  > - An optional description of how you intend to use the colors.
  
### 2.
 +  Your style should include a labeled section of the fonts  to be used (we recommend importing fonts from ***Google Fonts***).
 +  For each font, the goal is to to demonstrate the various styles that you intend to use (***font weight, style, size, and text decorations***). To do this, you should include the following for every font:  
    + ***The font name*** 
    + A series of styles that you intend to use (for example, styles could include: plain, **bold** and *italic*, *underlined*).
  
### 3.  
> In addition to the list of possible fonts, your style guide should include a section for specific text styles for page elements. For example, you could set main heading *```(<h1>)```* guidelines about text size, fonts, font styles, font weight, and more.
> Include at least 3 element styles, and ideally as many as you’d like to use in future sites.     

### 4.
> Add any additional styles that you’d like to include to make your style guide/design system look great. This could include ***positioning*** , ***layout***, ***additional colors***, ***box model properties***, and more.
